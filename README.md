## Purpose

I'm trying to make a hello-world angular module distributable through Bower.
I'm following this guide for _"bowerize"_ the module: [http://briantford.com/blog/angular-bower](http://briantford.com/blog/angular-bower)

## Installed npm sripts

Lint code script: ```npm run lint```

Minify and concat with uglify: ```npm run uglify``` 

Minify and concat with browserfy: ```npm run build```

watch and build: ```npm run watch```

## Demo page

You can run the demo page with ```npm start``` and pointing your browser to [http://localhost:8080/demo]


# Tests making a resuable and bowerizable angular module

Not yet implemented.

I will follow this guide to configure manally the tests: [https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/unit-testing-angularjs-applications](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/unit-testing-angularjs-applications)

Work in progress at branch ```adding_karma```
